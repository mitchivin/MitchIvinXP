    "description": "Created a comprehensive video package for The Anglican Church Grammar School's prestigious rugby lunch at The Star, held during the British and Irish Lions tour year. The project included player introduction videos for three international rugby legends (Adam Ashley-Cooper, Rory Best, and Jason Leonard) and a 10-minute highlight reel of the 2013 Lions tour that welcomed 1100 guests as they entered the venue.<br><br>Each player's career highlights were crafted to sync with their stage entrance across a five-screen display setup, with legendary Australian commentator Greg Clark as MC. The introduction videos celebrated each legend's defining moments, representing Australia, Ireland, and England respectively.<br><br>Working with The Star's cutting-edge display technology required upscaling all archival footage to 4K 60fps, ensuring every try, tackle, and defining moment hit with maximum visual impact in the venue.",

The window management system includes proper stacking, taskbar integration, menubars, toolbars, and status bars that all function as expected.<br><br>What started as an ambitious vision with no coding background evolved through hundreds of hours of problem-solving, iteration, and meticulous attention to detail. Each Windows behavior had to be carefully recreated, tested, and refined. The real challenge came in making this desktop-first interface fully responsive while preserving the authentic experience across all devices. Some portfolio conventions were deliberately broken to maintain the Windows illusion.",
