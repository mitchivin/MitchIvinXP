      "I’m Mitch, a graphic designer based in Brisbane, Australia. I work across social graphics, motion, and web, taking ideas from concept through to delivery. I studied at Brisbane Boys’ College, where I learned the value of discipline, teamwork, and shared purpose.",
      "Growing up in New Zealand, seeing how the All Blacks were presented to the nation and the pride they inspired showed me that design can do more than create a visual impression. It can build identity, foster pride, and connect people in ways that go far beyond appearance.",
      "In my twenties, I committed to design professionally, completing a Diploma of Graphic Design at Queensland TAFE. Since then, I’ve worked with clients on event video packages and front-end UI projects, delivering work for live and public use while continually refining my craft.",
      "Design gives me the same drive and focus that sport always has. I care about detail, process, and pushing my own standard with each project. My long-term goal is to bring those strengths to a major sports franchise and create work with lasting impact."
